# Carter FED Test

Code test for potential Carter front-end developers

## The solution:

### Tech Stack: HTML, CSS and JavaScript

* I have used semantic HTML code structure for better readability and accessibility.
* CSS Flexbox model is used for flexibility and responsiveness.
* JavaScript is used to fetch JSON data and load that data in a grid format in HTML doc.

### Tools

* NPM for installing and maintaining project dependencies.
* Gulp for bundling, minifying HTML, CSS and JavaScript files, Sass to CSS compilation, live-server testing etc.
* Sublime Text 3 as a text editor.
